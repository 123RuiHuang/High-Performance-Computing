use command  "make" to compile the project
use command "make run" to run the program
use command "make clean" to delete HW5_GPU lena_* HW5_CPU cmp


note: when you use the command "make", it might produce some error. This is
because the path of the /cuda/samples/common/inc/ in my environment is
 differentfrom your environment. You just need to change it in Makefile to
 the path in youenvironment
